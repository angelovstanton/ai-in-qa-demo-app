## Overview

The City Services Portal is a comprehensive municipal service management system designed as a testing playground for QA tools. It includes 51 configurable bugs/issues that can be toggled on or off to test whether automated testing tools can detect various types of problems.

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Application

1. **Main Application**: http://localhost:5173
2. **API Documentation**: http://localhost:3001/api-docs
3. **Admin Panel**: Login as admin@city.gov and navigate to Admin section

### Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Start the application
cd city-services-portal
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd api && npm install && npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd ui && npm install && npm run dev
```

## Test Accounts

All test accounts use the password: **`password123`**

| Role | Email | Purpose |

## Feature Flag System

The application has two types of feature flags:

### 1. Standard Feature Flags
Located at: `/admin/flags` (requires admin login)

| Flag | What It Does When Enabled |
|------|---------------------------|
| **API_Random500** | 5% of API requests randomly fail with 500 errors |
| **API_SlowRequests** | 10% of requests are delayed by 3-5 seconds |
| **API_UploadIntermittentFail** | File uploads randomly fail |
| **UI_WrongDefaultSort** | Tables sort in wrong direction by default |
| **UI_MissingAria_Search** | Search fields lack accessibility labels |

### 2. Testing Feature Flags
Located at: `/admin/testing-flags` (requires admin login)

These 51 flags simulate various bugs and issues for QA testing purposes.

## Complete List of Testing Flags

### Master Control (1 flag)

| Flag | Impact | What Happens When Enabled |
|------|--------|---------------------------|
| **MASTER_TESTING_FLAGS_ENABLED** | HIGH | Acts as a global switch - must be ON for other flags to work. When OFF, all other testing flags are disabled regardless of their individual settings. |

### Authentication & User Management (10 flags)

| Flag | Impact | What Happens When Enabled |
