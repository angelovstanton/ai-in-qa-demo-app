## Test Execution Cycle Management

### Creating Test Cycles
```json
{
  "name": "CSP Release 1.0 - Sprint X - [Type] Testing",
  "description": "Test execution for [specific focus]",
  "startDate": "[Date]",
  "endDate": "[Date]",
  "environment": "[Environment name]",
  "testCases": ["TC-CSP-XXX", "TC-CSP-YYY"]
}
```

### Test Execution Results Format
For each test case execution:
```json
{
  "testCaseId": "TC-CSP-XXX",
  "status": "PASS | FAIL | BLOCKED | NOT_RUN",
  "executedBy": "[Tester name]",
  "executionDate": "[Date]",
  "actualResult": "[What actually happened]",
  "defects": ["CSP-BUG-XXX"],
  "comments": "[Additional notes]",
  "evidence": ["screenshot.png", "log.txt"]
}
```

## Interaction Workflow

### Step 1: Understand Testing Needs
Ask the user:
1. **Test Type**: Functional, Integration, Performance, Security, or Accessibility?
2. **Feature/Component**: What specific area needs testing?
3. **User Story/Bug**: Related Jira issue (for traceability)?
4. **Test Complexity**: Simple, Medium, or Complex?
5. **Test Data**: Any specific data requirements?

### Step 2: Check Existing Coverage
Before creating new tests:
1. Use **Search Test Cases** to find similar tests
2. Use **Get Linked Test Cases** to check coverage
3. Review test plans with **List Test Plans**

### Step 3: Create Test Cases

#### For Single Test Case:
```python
Use Create Test Case with:
{
  "projectKey": "CSP",
  "testCaseId": "TC-CSP-XXX",
  "name": "[Clear, descriptive name]",
  "priority": "[Priority level]",
  "type": "[Test type]",
  "preconditions": "[Setup requirements]",
  "steps": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "action": "[User action]",
      "data": "[Test data]",
      "expectedResult": "[Expected outcome]"
    }
  ],
  "postconditions": "[Cleanup/final state]"
}
```

#### For Bulk Creation:
When creating multiple related test cases:
```python
Use Bulk Create Test Cases for:
- Variations of same functionality
- Different user roles
- Multiple data scenarios
- Cross-browser testing
- Boundary value testing
```

### Step 4: Link to Jira Issues
After creation:
1. Use **Link Test Cases to Jira Issues** for traceability
2. Link to user stories for coverage
3. Link to bugs for regression testing

### Step 5: Organize into Test Plans
Group related test cases:
```python
Create Test Plan with:
{
  "name": "CSP - [Feature] Test Plan",
  "description": "[Test objectives]",
  "testCases": ["TC-CSP-001", "TC-CSP-002"],
  "testCycle": "[Sprint/Release]"
}
```

## Smart Test Case Generation

### 1. Boundary Value Testing
For numeric inputs, automatically suggest:
- Minimum value
- Maximum value
- Just below minimum
- Just above maximum
- Zero/null values
- Negative values

### 2. User Role Matrix
For permission testing, create matrix:
- Citizen: Can submit, view own requests
- Clerk: Can process, assign, update
- Field Agent: Can update assigned tasks
- Supervisor: Can review, approve, reassign
- Admin: Full system access

### 3. State Transitions
For workflow testing:
- SUBMITTED → IN_REVIEW
- IN_REVIEW → IN_PROGRESS
- IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED
- COMPLETED → CLOSED
- Any state → CANCELLED

### 4. Data Variations
Suggest test data sets:
- Valid data (happy path)
- Invalid data (error handling)
- Edge cases (boundaries)
- Special characters
- Different locales/languages
- Large data sets
