### Bug: CSRP-13 - Search API returns 500 error with special characters

**Type**: Bug  
**Priority**: High  
**Severity**: High  
**Status**: Open  
**Sprint**: Sprint 4  
**Reporter**: Automatic  
**Related Story**: CSRP-8  

**Description:**

## Bug Description
Search API returns HTTP 500 error when users include special characters like quotes, backslashes, or SQL keywords in the search query.

## Environment
- Environment: Production
- API Version: 1.0.0
- Endpoint: GET /api/requests/search

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Send GET request to /api/requests/search
2. Include special characters in query parameter: q="test' OR '1'='1"
3. Observe response

## Expected Result
- API should sanitize input and return valid results or empty array
- Special characters should be properly escaped
- HTTP 200 response with appropriate results

## Actual Result
- HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
- Error message: "Database query failed"
- Stack trace exposed in development mode

## Severity
High - Security vulnerability (SQL injection risk)

## Priority
Urgent

## Root Cause Analysis
Query parameter not properly sanitized before database query execution.

## Proposed Fix
- Implement parameterized queries
- Add input sanitization middleware
- Use query builder with proper escaping

## Related Story

### Bug: CSRP-14 - Pagination breaks when filtering by multiple statuses

**Type**: Bug  
**Priority**: High  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Status**: Open  
**Sprint**: Sprint 5  
**Reporter**: Automatic  
**Related Story**: CSRP-8  

**Description:**

## Bug Description
Pagination functionality breaks when users apply multiple status filters simultaneously, causing incorrect page numbers and missing results.

## Environment
- Environment: Staging
- Frontend Version: 2.1.0
- Browser: Chrome 119, Firefox 118

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to request list page
2. Apply multiple status filters (e.g., SUBMITTED + IN_PROGRESS + COMPLETED)
3. Navigate to page 2
4. Observe pagination controls and results

## Expected Result
- Correct total count displayed
- Page navigation works properly
- All filtered results accessible
- Page numbers accurate

## Actual Result
- Total count incorrect (shows unfiltered total)
- Page 2 shows "No results found" despite having data
- Pagination controls show wrong number of pages
- Some results are inaccessible

## Severity
Medium - Core functionality affected

## Priority
High

## Root Cause Analysis
Filter state not properly synchronized with pagination logic. Count query doesn't include filter criteria.

## Proposed Fix
- Update count query to include filters
- Synchronize filter state with pagination
- Reset to page 1 when filters change

## Related Story
CSRP-8: Implement advanced search API with pagination

## Regression Testing Required
- Test all filter combinations
- Test pagination with 0, 1, multiple pages

### Bug: CSRP-15 - File upload fails for PDFs over 5MB

**Type**: Bug  
**Priority**: High  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Status**: Open  
**Sprint**: Sprint 4  
**Reporter**: Automatic  
**Related Story**: CSRP-7  

**Description:**

## Bug Description
File upload functionality fails when users try to upload PDF files larger than 5MB, despite the documented limit being 10MB per file.

## Environment
- Environment: Production
- Backend Version: 1.0.0
- Endpoint: POST /api/requests/:id/attachments

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a new service request
2. Navigate to attachments section
3. Select a PDF file between 5MB and 10MB
4. Click upload
5. Observe the result

## Expected Result
- PDF file uploads successfully
- Progress bar shows upload progress
- File appears in attachments list
- Success notification displayed

## Actual Result
- Upload fails at around 30 seconds
- Error message: "Upload timeout"
- No file saved
- User must retry with smaller file

## Severity
Medium - Feature partially broken

## Priority
High

## Root Cause Analysis
Multer middleware configuration has incorrect timeout and size handling for PDF MIME type.

## Proposed Fix
- Update Multer configuration for PDF handling
- Increase timeout for large files
- Implement chunked upload for files > 5MB
- Add proper MIME type validation

## Related Story

### Bug: CSRP-16 - Authentication token not refreshing properly

**Type**: Bug  
**Priority**: Urgent  
**Severity**: High  
**Status**: Open  
**Sprint**: Sprint 5  
**Reporter**: Automatic  
**Related Story**: CSRP-9  

**Description:**

## Bug Description
JWT authentication tokens are not refreshing properly before expiry, causing users to be logged out unexpectedly while actively using the system.

## Environment
- Environment: Production
- Auth Service Version: 1.0.0
- Affected Endpoints: All authenticated endpoints

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Login to the system
2. Use the application normally for 25-30 minutes
3. Continue using the application past the 30-minute mark
4. Observe authentication behavior

## Expected Result
- Token should auto-refresh before expiry
- User remains logged in during active use
- Seamless experience with no interruption
- Refresh token used automatically

## Actual Result
- Token expires at exactly 30 minutes
- User gets 401 Unauthorized error
- Redirected to login page
- Loss of unsaved work

## Severity
High - Major UX issue

## Priority
Urgent

## Root Cause Analysis
Token refresh logic not triggered properly. Client-side refresh mechanism fails to detect upcoming expiry.

## Proposed Fix
- Implement token refresh 5 minutes before expiry
- Add retry logic for failed refresh attempts
- Store refresh token securely
- Implement proper token rotation

## Related Story
CSRP-9: Create user authentication service

## Impact
- All authenticated users affected
- Productivity loss due to re-login
- Potential data loss

## Workaround
Users can manually refresh the page every 25 minutes to trigger token refresh.

## Test Scenarios
- Token refresh at 25-minute mark
- Multiple tab handling
- Refresh token expiry

- No JavaScript execution
- HTML entities properly encoded

## Actual Result
- Script tag stored as-is in database
- JavaScript executes when viewing request
- Alert box appears
- Potential for malicious code execution

## Severity
Critical - Security vulnerability

## Priority
Urgent

## Root Cause Analysis
- Client-side validation insufficient
- Server-side sanitization missing
- Output not properly escaped in UI

## Proposed Fix
- Implement DOMPurify for client-side sanitization
- Add server-side HTML stripping
- Escape all user content on display
- Add Content Security Policy headers

## Related Story

### Task: CSRP-20 - Set up monitoring and logging infrastructure

**Type**: Task  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: To Do  
**Sprint**: Sprint 5  
**Team Assignment**: Infrastructure Team  

**Description:**

## Task Description
Set up comprehensive monitoring and logging infrastructure to track system health, performance, and user activities.

## Purpose
Ensure system observability for debugging, performance optimization, and security auditing.

## Monitoring Scope
- Application performance metrics
- API response times
- Database query performance
- Error rates and types
- User activity tracking
- Resource utilization

## Logging Requirements
```javascript
// Log Levels
- ERROR: System errors, exceptions
- WARN: Performance issues, deprecations
- INFO: User actions, system events
- DEBUG: Detailed execution flow

// Log Categories
- Authentication: Login/logout events
- API: Request/response details
- Database: Query execution times
- Security: Failed attempts, violations
- Performance: Slow queries, timeouts
```

## Tools to Configure
1. Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
   - New Relic or DataDog
   - Custom metrics dashboard
   
2. Log Management
   - ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
   - Log rotation policies
   
3. Error Tracking
   - Sentry integration
   - Error alerting

4. Uptime Monitoring
   - Health check endpoints
   - Availability monitoring

## Deliverables
1. Monitoring dashboard
2. Alert configurations
3. Log aggregation setup
4. Performance baselines
5. Runbook for common issues

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All critical paths monitored
- [ ] Alerts configured for failures
- [ ] Logs searchable and indexed
- [ ] Dashboard shows real-time metrics
- [ ] 30-day log retention
- [ ] GDPR-compliant logging

## Metrics to Track
- Request rate (req/sec)
- Error rate (4xx, 5xx)
- Response time (p50, p95, p99)
- Database connection pool
- Memory usage
- CPU utilization
